<h1>Gala Groceries - Stock Level Prediction</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA. They strive to provide the best quality, fresh produce from locally sourced suppliers. To optimize their supply chain and stock management, they approached Cognizant for assistance. The main challenge is accurately predicting stock levels based on sales data and sensor data to intelligently procure products from suppliers.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
"Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis to more intelligently procure products from our suppliers?"

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
The client has provided three datasets:

Sales Data: Contains information about product sales, such as product ID, timestamp, and quantity sold.
Temperature Sensor Data: Includes temperature measurements in the storage facilities where products are stored in the warehouse.
Stock Levels Sensor Data: Consists of stock levels within the refrigerators and freezers in-store.
<h2>Data Model</h2>
The Data Engineering team has created a data model diagram. After reviewing the diagram, we have identified the following data to be used for the analysis:

Sales Data: Product ID, Timestamp, Quantity Sold
Temperature Sensor Data: Timestamp, Temperature Measurement
Stock Levels Sensor Data: Timestamp, Stock Level
<h2>Strategic Plan</h2>
To address the problem statement, we propose the following strategic plan:

Data Preparation:

Clean and preprocess the sales data, temperature sensor data, and stock levels sensor data.
Merge the datasets based on the common timestamp column.
Feature Engineering:

Extract additional features from the merged dataset, such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month.
Calculate aggregate statistics, such as daily sales, average temperature, and stock level.
Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Apply a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as a regression model, to train on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using business-friendly metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).
Model Deployment:

Prepare a Python module containing code to train the model and output performance metrics.
Package the module into a production-ready format for seamless integration into Gala Groceries' systems.
<h2>Presentation of Results</h2>
Once the modeling process is complete, we will summarize the analysis and results in a concise and business-friendly PowerPoint slide. The slide will include the following information:

Problem statement: Accurately predicting stock levels based on sales and sensor data.
Methodology: Data preparation, feature engineering, model development, and model deployment.
Key findings and performance metrics: Highlight the accuracy of the model using metrics like MAE and RMSE.
Recommendations: Suggest potential improvements and the importance of incorporating more data over time.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Gala Groceries recognizes the value of machine learning in optimizing their stock management. The initial results from the machine learning model are promising, indicating its potential to add real value to the business. By implementing a Python module for training and performance evaluation, we can move closer to deploying the algorithm into production.
